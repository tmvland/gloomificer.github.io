# gloomificer.github.io
Hello! I'm TJ (also known as gloomificer). I'm known as an artist to some and a scientist to others and I have a variety of interests spanning these categories. I'm hoping to establish this site as a home base for some of my larger creative works. However, at present it is sadly under construction. Thanks for checking in-- watch this space for updates!
